## Energy Dashboard - API

### Enable write operations

By default, only GET operation is allowed, thanks to the contribution by [@VicAv99](https://www.github.com/VicAv99) at [#6](https://github.com/kitloong/json-server-vercel/issues/6), we can now enable write operations as well.

You can find the example code in [`api/server.js`](./api/server.js).
